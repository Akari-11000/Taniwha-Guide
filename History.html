    <h1 style="margin-left: 10px;">History :</h1>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">The human history of New Zealand can be dated back to between 1320 and 1350 CE, when the main settlement period started, after it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture. Like other Pacific cultures, Māori society was centred on kinship links and connection with the land but, unlike them, it was adapted to a cool, temperate environment rather than a warm, tropical one. The first European explorer known to have visited New Zealand was the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, on 13 December 1642.[1] In 1643 he charted the west coast of the North Island, his expedition then sailed back to Batavia without setting foot on New Zealand soil. British explorer James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European to circumnavigate and map New Zealand.[2] From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers.</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">On 6 February 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between representatives of the United Kingdom and various Māori chiefs, initially at Waitangi and over the following weeks at other locations across the country. On 21 May 1840, New Zealand entered the British Empire when Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty at Kororareka (Russell). Disputes over the differing versions of the Treaty and settler desire to acquire land from Māori led to the New Zealand Wars from 1843. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the 19th century and into the early part of the next century. The effects of European infectious diseases,the New Zealand Wars, and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to European (Pākehā) ownership, and Māori became impoverished.</h3>

    <h1 style="margin-left: 10px;">Legends :</h1>


    <h2 class="contect-title"   style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">The legendary Taniwha</h2>
    <img class="img-history" src="	https://i2.wp.com/hauntedauckland.com/site/wp-content/uploads/Taniwha.jpg" alt="taniwha" width="700" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Taniwha are supernatural creatures – monsters, if you will – that feature prominently in Māori legends. Some are akin to giant lizards, others are more reptile-like and some even take the shape of sharks and whales. Even today, some Māori believe in the existence of these creatures, especially within rivers and waterways. One of the most famous taniwha is Tuhirangi – Kupe’s guardian as he explored the Cook Strait and became the first Polynesian to reach New Zealand’s shores.</h3>

    
    <h2 class="contect-title"   style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Tāwhirimātea  god of the weather</h2>
    <img class="img-history" src="	https://blog.metservice.com/sites/default/files/u27/Whiting-Tawhiri_LrgDoc.jpg" alt="god" width="700" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Tāwhirimātea was another son of Ranginui and Papatūānuku – and the only one against separating his parents. In his anger he sent his children – the four winds and clouds – to wreak havoc on Earth with bouts of rain and thunderstorms. Tāne’s forests were destroyed in the process, but in the end Tūmatauenga (the ‘god of the people’) was able to defeat his spiteful sibling.</h3>


    <h2 class="contect-title"   style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Tāne separates the Earth and the Sky</h2>
    <img class="img-history" src="https://images.twinkl.co.uk/tw1n/image/private/t_630/u/ux/rangi-and-papa_ver_1.png" alt="Earth" width="700" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;"> In Māori tradition, Tāne is the originator of human life and the world as we know it. He is given various names in accordance with the different roles he has played in local legends. The most common story involving Tāne, however, was his feat in separating his parents Ranginui (the sky father) and Papatūānuku (earth mother) from the tight embrace that enveloped the world in darkness.</h3>


    <h2 class="contect-title"   style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Māngōroa – the shark that formed the Milky Way</h2>
    <img class="img-history" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VENkgqsn3sQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="shark" width="700" height="400">

    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Sharks in Polynesian tradition are viewed as guardian spirits. Māori mythology also follows this notion – and Te Māngōroa is probably the most famous of its tales. Legend has it that Māui placed the shark Māngōroa high up in the sky, thus forming what we know as the Milky Way.</h3>


    <h2 class="contect-title"   style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Ruatepupuke and the discovery of wood carving</h2>
    <img class="img-history" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b5/45/17/b545176fc2b4822b026b8cf018b81b69--maori-art-woodcarving.jpg" alt="wood carving" width="700" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Wood carving is a strong component of Māori tradition – and the legend surrounding it is quite interesting. Ruatepupuke supposedly discovered the artform on his journey to rescue his son, Te Manuhauturuki, who had been imprisoned by Tangaroa deep in the ocean. Te Manuhauturuki was mounted at the gables of the sea god’s house, where Ruatepupuke discovered the carved posts talking among themselves.</h3>
