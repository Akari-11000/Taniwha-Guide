    <h1 class="contect-title"  style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Fish and chips</h1>
    <img class="img-food" src="https://assets.ekotoken.ng/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/07/20151138/fish-and-chips-el-tradicional-plato-britanico.jpg" alt="fish" width="500" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">The first dish most New Zealanders would claim represents their country is the classic fish and chips, or as the Kiwis say, "fush and chups." The origin of this staple takeaway meal is almost certainly Great Britain, where the tradition of eating fish on a Friday due to religious reasons boosted the meal's ranking in British cuisine. Interestingly, the idea of battering fish most likely came to Britain from Western Sephardic Jewish immigrants in the 17th century, who used a batter of water and flour to increase its shelf-life.</h3>

    <h1 class="contect-title"  style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Kumara</h1>
    <img class="img-food" src="https://img.taste.com.au/8vbYvVCE/w1200-h630-cfill/taste/2016/11/kumara-47474-1.jpg" alt="Kumara" width="500" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Although kumara is technically one type of food and not an entire meal, it's impossible to compile a list of New Zealand's traditional dishes without including the ubiquitous vegetable. To the rest of the world, a kumara is simply a sweet potato, but this tuber has great cultural significance to New Zealand's early settlers. There's a consensus on the origin of kumara in New Zealand – many claim the first Polynesian settlers introduced it around the 13th century, having brought it with them from South America and proving historic contact between the two distant continents. Modern research indicates it's possible kumara made its way across the Pacific without human intervention but the fact remains that it's been a staple food in New Zealand for centuries</h3>

    <h1 class="contect-title"  style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Whitebait</h1>
    <img class="img-food" src="https://frozenfish.direct/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/devilled-whitebait-238815032.jpg" alt="Whitebait" width="500" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Whitebait is another traditional Māori food that became a favorite with European settlers and has only grown in popularity over the years. Whitebait is the collective name for juvenile fish, and in New Zealand, it specifically applies to five galaxiid species that live as adults in freshwater streams and rivers. However, the juveniles begin their journey at sea and are usually caught on their journey back to their freshwater habitats.</h3>

    <h1 class="contect-title"  style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Rēwena bread</h1>
    <img class="img-food" src="https://supervalue.imgix.net/assets/recipes/iStock-1125389587.jpg" alt="Bread" width="500" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Rēwena bread — parāoa rēwena in the Māori language — is a form of sourdough bread with strong ties to traditional Māori culture. Like other sourdoughs, rēwena is leavened with a fermenting starter; however, in this case, a unique potato-based starter, called a "bug," is used. A bug can be made days before the bread is baked and like other starters, can be kept alive indefinitely as long as the yeast is fed. In fact, some Māori families pass bugs on from one generation to the next, treating it as a treasured heirloom and piece of their history.</h3>

    <h1 class="contect-title"  style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">  Bluff oysters</h1>
    <img class="img-food" src="	https://www.foodlovers.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/oysters.jpg" alt="oysters" width="500" height="400">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">New Zealand is home to both Pacific and Bluff oysters, although it's the latter that have gained international fame and are most closely associated with the seafood-loving nation. Bluff oysters have been harvested in the Foveaux Strait in the very south of New Zealand for more than 100 years and gained their name from the town of Bluff, a settlement that owes its existence and growth to the oystering industry.</h3>
