    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">A pedestrian mall in Christchurch. Built as a private development in the early 1930s with 40 shops in Spanish Mission architectural style, it is one of the city's major tourist attractions. Providing a number of small shops as a comprehensive development was an advanced idea at the time, and New Regent Street is regarded as a forerunner to modern shopping malls. Due to its coherent architectural character, the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand, and in addition, the entire street has a historic area listing. The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the Christchurch heritage tram, which began operation in February 1995. Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the street and buildings reopened in April 2013.</h3>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">Official memorial for those killed or seriously injured in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It is located on both sides of the Avon River downstream from the Montreal Street bridge. The memorial opened on 22 February 2017, the sixth anniversary of the earthquake.The memorial comprises two integrated spaces on either side of the river - a memorial wall area on the south bank and a reflective space on the north bank - linked by the Montreal St bridge. On the south bank, a 111-metre-long curved wall bears the names of all 185 victims of the earthquake. The inscriptions, written and arranged in consultation with the bereaved families, are in both English and the deceased's first language, including Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Serbian and Thai. A landscaped area on the north side allows visitors to sit and view the memorial wall on the opposite bank.</h3>

    <h1 class="contect-title" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">Victoria Clock Tower</h1>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">The clock tower was commissioned by the Provincial Council and designed by Benjamin Mountfort. The tower was made in England and received in 147 packages in December 1860. The clock and tower were erected temporarily at the southern end of the Provincial Buildings but proved too heavy for the wooden tower at the southwest corner of the timber debating chamber.</h3>
